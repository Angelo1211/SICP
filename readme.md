# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

Repo containing my notes & code for SICP. Using this as an opportunity to program in a language completely different from the one I use at work :D.

I'm using racket as my compiler/interpreter and the #lang sicp package instead of actual scheme to be compatible with the textbook.
